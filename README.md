## üöÄ Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Dependency

#### **Kotlin DSL**
```kotlin
implementation("com.github.Luna-Exchange:icc-wrapped-android:x.x.x")
```

#### **Groovy DSL**
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.Luna-Exchange:icc-wrapped-android:x.x.x'
```
Replace `x.x.x` with the latest version (`1.0.4`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure `settings.gradle`

#### **Kotlin DSL**
```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

#### **Groovy DSL**
```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sync the project
Run a Gradle sync in your Android project.

## üì≤ Launching the SDK

### **When a user is authenticated**
```kotlin
     IccRecappedActivity.launch(context = this, user = user, env = Env.DEVELOPMENT, onStayInGame = {})
```

### **When a user is not authenticated**, where onAuthenticate is a callback where ICC can login and relaunch the SDK again.
```kotlin
     IccRecappedActivity.launch(context = this, env = Env.DEVELOPMENT, onStayInGame = {}, onAuthenticate = onAuthenticate)
```

### **Delegate Sign-in to ICC**
If sign-in is required after clicking a `enter recapped` button in the SDK, implement the `OnAuthenticate` interface:

```kotlin
val onAuthenticate = object : OnAuthenticate {
    override fun signIn() {
        val user = User(email, authToken, name)
        IccRecappedActivity.launch(this@MainActivity, user, onStayInGame = {})
    }
}
```

### **Delegate Sign-in to ICC**
`onStayInGame` is a function passed into the sdk during initialization it gets invoked when the ICC recapped is completed and the user clicks on the `ICC CRICKET` button as shown below.

## üèóÔ∏è Launch Arguments
The SDK launch function accepts arguments:

### **User Data**
```kotlin
val userData = User(
    token = "user_token",
    name = "User Name",
    email = "user@example.com"
)
```

### **Environment**
The `Env` enum is used to specify the SDK environment:

```kotlin
enum class Env {
    DEVELOPMENT,
    PRODUCTION
}
```

### **Stay in Game callback (onStayInGame) **
This interface closes the SDK and provides a callback that allows the SDK caller to navigate to another section of the ICC app after the recapped experience is completed.

---
### **Authentication Delegation**
This interface helps with sign-in delegation when the user attempts to sign in via **IccRecapped**.

This  applies to users who clicked the `enter recapped` button on the WebView **IccRecapped** without being authenticated via the ICC app.

When calling the SDK, pass an authentication interface as an argument, handle sign in the document and launch the sdk again:

```kotlin
val onAuthenticate = object : OnAuthenticate {
    override fun signIn() {
        IccRecappedActivity.launch(this@MainActivity, user, onStayInGame = {})
    }

    override fun onNavigateBack() {
       // when on back pressed is called
    }
}
```



In this interface, 
1. The `signIn()` function handles authentication and then launches the SDK with the user object.
2. The `onNavigateBack()` function is triggered when the user presses back on the SDK.

**Permissions**

The SDK automatically requests for permissions if enabled it loads the ICC wrapped experience if it is not enabled it's forces the user to enable before launching the webview
